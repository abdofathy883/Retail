# Retail ‚Äì Backend API for E-Commerce & POS Platform

Retail is a modular ASP.NET Core backend that powers a unified e-commerce storefront and point-of-sale (POS) admin system. It provides role-based APIs for managing products, vendors, categories, customer orders, and cashier-placed transactions.

## üß† Project Overview

This backend serves two Angular frontends:
- A public-facing **e-commerce UI** for customers
- An internal **admin/POS dashboard** for staff

The system handles:
- Product management with variants (color, size, etc.)
- Order and invoice tracking
- Secure authentication with role-based policies
- Real-time POS order submission (manual input)
